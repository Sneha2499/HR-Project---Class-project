Objectives
•	Analyze the overall attrition rate and understand the key factors contributing to employee turnover.
•	Evaluate the impact of job satisfaction, tenure, age, education field, department, job role, salary levels, and work-life balance on attrition.
•	Provide actionable recommendations to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

Key Insights
•	The company has an attrition rate of 16.1%, with 238 employees leaving out of 1480.
•	The average tenure of 7.01 years indicates overall job satisfaction among employees.
•	The workforce's average age is 37 years, with the highest attrition among employees aged 26-35 (116 people) and the lowest among those aged 55 and above (8 people).
•	Employees from the Life Sciences and Medical fields have the highest attrition rates, with 89 (37.39%) and 63 (26.47%) people leaving, respectively. The HR field has the lowest attrition with 7 people (2.94%).
•	Department-wise, R&D has the highest attrition (133 employees), while HR has the lowest (12 employees).
•	Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have the highest attrition rates among job roles, with 62 and 17 employees leaving, respectively. Both roles also reported low job satisfaction.
•	A significant number of employees (59) left after one year, and the attrition rate decreases over time, becoming negligible after 10 years.
•	Lower salary levels contribute to higher attrition, particularly among freshers. Of the 163 employees earning up to $5000, 40 were new and likely left for better opportunities.
•	Entry-level job roles saw the highest attrition (143 employees), while only 5 people in leadership roles left.
•	Overtime does not significantly influence attrition, with 53% of the employees who left having done overtime.
•	Work-life balance is not a major factor in attrition, as 128 employees who left rated their work-life balance as satisfactory.
Conclusion
The data indicates that attrition is mainly driven by low salaries and job dissatisfaction, particularly among freshers and those in specific job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives. The high turnover in the Life Sciences and Medical fields and among R&D employees highlights the need for targeted interventions.

Recommendations:
•	Increase salaries, especially for entry-level positions and freshers, to reduce attrition caused by low pay.
•	Enhance job satisfaction for Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives by addressing specific issues and providing better career progression opportunities, recognition, and support.
•	Implement retention strategies tailored for the Life Sciences and Medical fields, as well as the R&D department, including additional training, career development programs, and improving working conditions.
•	Regularly review and adjust compensation packages to ensure they are competitive and in line with industry standards, particularly for roles with high attrition rates.
•	Maintain and improve work-life balance through regular surveys and feedback mechanisms to identify and address any emerging issues.
•	Develop onboarding and retention programs specifically for new hires to ensure they feel supported and valued from the beginning, reducing early-stage attrition.
•	Evaluate and adjust overtime policies to ensure fair compensation and prevent burnout, contributing to overall job satisfaction.
By implementing these recommendations, the company can address the key factors contributing to attrition and improve overall employee retention.
